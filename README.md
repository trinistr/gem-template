## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests, `rake rubocop` to lint code and check style compliance, `rake rbs` to validate signatures or just `rake` to do everything above. There is also `rake steep` to check typing, and `rake docs` to generate YARD documentation.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment, or `bin/benchmark` to run a benchmark script and generate a StackProf flamegraph.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, run `bundle exec rake version:{major|minor|patch}`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
